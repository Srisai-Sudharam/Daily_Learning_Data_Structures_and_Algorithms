1. Adjecency List
    This is a list of hashes where each element in a list has a hash of all its connected nodes
    here Access time is O(1)
    {
        1: {2, 3}
        2: {3, 4}
    }

2. Adjecency Matrix:
    There will be an N X N matix which will store 1 if there is an edge between two nodes otherwise 0 is stored
    
    * for an edge (3, 2) in a matrix it will check if AdjMtx[3][2] == 1 there is an edge between two vertices

    * Access O(1), but space is O(N^2)


so if the vertices are in order of N then it is better to prefer Adjecency List

if they are in order of N^2 any way we need N^2 space so use Adjecency Matrix
