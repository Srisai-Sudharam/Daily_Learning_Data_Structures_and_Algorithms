A Graph has vertices and Edges 
Each node in a graph is called a Vertex
Each connection between two node is called as an Edge

1. Adjacent vertices
    when two node are connected through an Edge then they are called adjacent vertices

2. Degree
    The number of edges passing through a vertex in a graph is called as degree of that Vertex
    A --- B  # here degree of B is 2, degree of A is 1, degree of C is 1
          |
          C
3. Path
    Path is the a connection or a path between two nodes

    A ----- B
            |
            C

    D ----- E

    In the above graph (A, C) have path but (A, E) does not have a path

4. Connected Graph
    A graph in which every two nodes have a path

    A ----- B           A ----- B
            |                   |
            C           D ----- C            

    D ----- E

    In above two graphs second graph is called connected graph first one is not a connected graph

5. Connected components
    In a graph all the sub graphs that are connected are called Connected components
    
    A ----- B
            |
            C

    D ----- E

    Here (A, B, C) is a connected component and (D, E) is another connected component

##  TREE :: A Tree is a connected graph with no cycles
