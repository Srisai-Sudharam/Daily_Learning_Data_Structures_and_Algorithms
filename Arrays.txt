Array is a datastructure with fixed size and where all elements are of same type are stored
contiguious memory allocation

access time = O(1) # you can directly access through index ***random access***

you just need to know the starting address you may find next element based on this

suppose starting address is 200, and lets say it is an integer array and it will occupy 4 bytes of memory then 

element at index 3 : 200 + 4 * (3 - start_index) in our case it is zero but this is a general formula

insertion:
    at end: O(1)
    at middle or beginning: O(N) because first it need to shift all other to right since its a contiguious memory allocation

deletion:
    same as insertion at end O(1), otherwise O(N)

finding an element:
     O(N) depends on algorithm you use
